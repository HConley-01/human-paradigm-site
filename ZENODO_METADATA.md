**Title:** The Human Paradigm: A Metaparadigmatic Analysis of Nature-Consciousness-Environment Integration

**Creators:**
- Kitcey, Robert D. (ORCID: 0009-0004-8679-9155)

**Description:**
This article presents a meta-theoretical analysis of the Human Paradigm framework, examining its philosophical foundations, epistemological commitments, and paradigmatic positioning within contemporary systems theory. The work explicates the triadic Nature-Consciousness-Environment (N-C-E) model as a metaparadigm capable of integrating diverse theoretical perspectives across psychology, sociology, ecology, and organizational science. Key contributions include formal articulation of the paradigm's core axioms, demonstration of its explanatory scope across multiple domains, and analysis of its relationship to existing theoretical frameworks.

**Title:** The Human Paradigm: A Comprehensive Framework for Nature-Consciousness-Environment Dynamics

**Creators:**
- Kitcey, Robert D. (ORCID: 0009-0004-8679-9155)

**Description:**
Foundational exposition of the Human Paradigm, establishing the triadic Nature-Consciousness-Environment (N-C-E) model as a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding human systems at multiple scales. This work integrates biological constraints (Nature), cognitive phenomena (Consciousness), and constructed environments (Environment) into a unified analytical structure. The framework provides diagnostic tools for analyzing dysfunction across individual, organizational, and societal levels, while offering intervention pathways grounded in thermodynamic principles and constraint theory. Includes detailed development of the S.C.I.E.N.C.E. inventory, FORCES/GRAVITY/ANCHORS/PRIMES constraint frameworks, and the Asymmetric Propagation Law governing system degradation and restoration dynamics.
