    "abstract": "This comprehensive work presents the NiCE Framework (Nature-Consciousness-Environment) as a unified triadic systems approach to understanding human behavior, cognition, and societal dynamics. It integrates insights from neuroscience, thermodynamics, cultural evolution, and philosophy to explain how biological constraints, symbolic narratives, and environmental pressures interact to shape human experience. Central to the framework is the Asymmetric Propagation Law: dysfunction propagates automatically across N-C-E levels while improvement propagates only conditionallyâ€”a principle derived directly from thermodynamics that explains civilizational drift, institutional decay, and why good intentions systematically fail.",
