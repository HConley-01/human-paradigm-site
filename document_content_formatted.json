      "text": "Human cognition evolved for environments where feedback was immediate, consequences were visible, and reality was locally legible. Modern civilizational systems operate at scales and speeds that exceed this evolutionary bandwidth. They suppress feedback, distort incentives, and replace ecological signals with symbolic ones. As these systems drift, abstract, and defer correction, they generate conditions in which individuals cannot reliably perceive consequences, distinguish beneficial from harmful actions, or align behavior with their own long-term welfare."
    },
    {
      "type": "p",
      "text": "This cognitive breakdown is not a personal failing. It is the lawful output of a system whose internal logic rewards maladaptive behavior and punishes alignment with reality. People behave \"rationally\" within distorted incentives while simultaneously acting against their own survival. Confusion, polarization, and moral ambiguity emerge naturally because the system hides causality, fragments perception, and eliminates viable alternatives."
    },
    {
      "type": "p",
      "text": "Pathology spreads by default, while improvement requires coordinated effort. Capture forces individuals to defend the very structures that undermine their welfare. Complexity erodes fallback capacity, leaving populations unable to survive outside the dominant system. Abstraction enters as catalyst, accelerating existing dysfunction while masking decline. Debt buffers overshoot by pulling future capacity into the present, masking ecological decline until the abstraction layer fails."

Collapse becomes the primary remaining form of correction once all intermediate pathways have been exhausted."

This model addresses the long-standing fragmentation of the human sciences by treating these domains not as isolated objects of study but as three co-evolving aspects of a single system (Kitayama & Park, 2010; Nisbett et al., 2001). By distinguishing constitutive (synchronic), causal (diachronic), and enabling (contextual) relations, the framework integrates insights from 4E cognition (Newen et al., 2018), niche construction and cultural evolution (Boyd & Richerson, 1985; Henrich, 2015), predictive processing and active inference (Friston, 2010; Hohwy, 2013), and developmental systems theory (Oyama et al., 2001)."

We formalize triadic dynamics through state-space learning, hierarchical Bayesian models of cultural priors, active-inference policy selection, and explicit metabolic constraints (Sterling & Laughlin, 2015). A measurement program specifies primary and secondary markers for N, C, and E and yields six testable predictions, including multi-lever intervention synergy, sensitive periods, symbolic mediation, plasticity bounds, cultural priors shaping metacognition, and rituals as control policies (Donald, 1991; Iriki et al., 1996; Lazar et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2007)."

Its promise lies in being both visionary and testable\u2014predicting, failing, and improving by design\u2014so that N, C, and E can be studied as one coupled system, guiding us toward lower load, clearer access, and richer affordances."

Building on this, Tomasello (1999) demonstrates how uniquely human cognition develops through culturally scaffolded practices of joint attention and shared intentionality, providing a developmental pathway through which symbolic systems and social norms become constitutive of human adaptation. Deacon (1997) further underscores this point by showing how language and symbolic reference co-evolved with the human brain, making symbolic mediation itself a selective environment. Finally, Markus and Kitayama (1991) illustrate how cultural contexts stabilize distinct forms of selfhood (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) and, at the neural level, shape the functional organization of the brain itself (Park & Huang, 2010)\u2014independent or interdependent\u2014that shape cognition, emotion, and motivation, exemplifying how symbolic niches consolidate into enduring modes of consciousness."

Importantly, this recursive process operates through neuroplastic mechanisms by which conscious experience and cultural practices reorganize neural circuits over time (Askenasy & Lehmann, 2013). The result is a dynamic, co-evolutionary process that unfolds across multiple timescales\u2014from the immediate effects of environmental changes on conscious experience, to the long-term evolutionary consequences of symbolic and cultural evolution."

We specify four causal pathways\u2014monetary expansion, scarcity mispricing, behavioral overshoot, and recursive financial engineering\u2014and derive falsifiable hypotheses for each. Across cases, we find patterns consistent with incentive misalignment: returns realized within financial symbol space with weak ties to productive output or ecological renewal. We outline measurement strategies, identify boundary conditions, and propose a pilot assessment instrument to realign incentives with biophysical limits and human well-being. We discuss limitations and alternative explanations, including innovation, compositional effects, and time-scale mismatches. (cf. \u00a74.4; \u00a74.3 cases)."

We therefore formalize the triad as a directed, time-indexed graph connecting latent states within and across time slices. Within a time slice, constitutive relations capture structural couplings (e.g., neuromodulatory tone constraining workspace dynamics). Across time slices, causal relations encode how present states shape future states via development, learning, and environmental change (Dehaene & Changeux, 2011)."
